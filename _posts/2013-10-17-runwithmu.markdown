<p>We want our running to be special, too. When we tell people we&rsquo;re marathoners or ultra-marathoners, we might privately enjoy the respectful comments we get back, the &ldquo;That&rsquo;s amazing, I could never do that&rdquo; responses. It&rsquo;s another interesting way to tag ourselves, to differentiate our personal brand. And if you can combine running and Zen, well, how cool is that?</p>
<p>Often running and meditation are just work, sweat, and routine, but we don&rsquo;t want to see them that way. And when we feel unsettled in our meditation, when a run doesn&rsquo;t go as smoothly as planned, we can feel like frauds, like we&rsquo;ve failed somehow. We haven&rsquo;t, no more so than if we accidentally dump the fresh cat litter on the floor or miss a strip of grass while mowing. It&rsquo;s just life, and we&rsquo;re just a little tired or making mistakes like we always do. &ldquo;Mistakes are part of the ritual,&rdquo; a Zen master replied when someone said they were worried about screwing up during a tea ceremony. So what if you spill the tea, if you don&rsquo;t hit your goal time on your last interval, if you sneeze during a sit? You&rsquo;re just what the ancient Zen dudes in Japan called a &ldquo;skin bag,&rdquo; and a sweating, fumbling, sneezing skin bag is going to do things less than perfectly.</p>
