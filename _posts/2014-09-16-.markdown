<p><em>Sometimes God challenges you to find strength you don&rsquo;t have.</em><br /><em>Only like this will you go beyond your imagined limits.</em><br /><em>You must be pushed so far that you are forced to be humble.&nbsp;</em><br /><em>Only then, when your pride and arrogance are crushed, will you discover muscles that are not yours. You will find and use the muscles of God.&nbsp;</em><br /><span class="text_exposed_show"><br /><em>When you completely abandon yourself, your ego, this miracle becomes possible.</em><br /><br /><strong><em>Mooji</em></strong></span></p>
