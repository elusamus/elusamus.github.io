title: "Maratonistuvad kehad"
---
<p><em>"Our society is one not of spectacle, but of surveillance; under the surface of images,</em><em> one invests bodies in depth; behind the great abstraction of exchange, there continues</em><em> the meticulous, concrete training of useful forces [...];<br />it is not that the beautiful</em><em> totality of the individual is amputated, repressed, altered by our social order, it is</em><em> rather that the individual is carefully fabricated in it, according to a whole technique</em><em> of forces and bodies." (M. Foucault)</em></p>&#13;
<p>Mida on maratonijooksu silmas pidades edasi arendatud...üks mõlgutus:</p>&#13;
<p><em>"Foucault’s theory lends itself to the suggestion that the marathon is another regulating institution that encourages productive, obedient behaviour, or ‘docile bodies’. Despite the marathon being experienced by participants as an entirely voluntary undertaking, the marathon could be argued to share qualities with the panopticon:<br />the internalization of societal expectations regarding health, fitness and charitable giving transformed into selfregulations and self-discipline on an extreme scale, played out in a public spectacle. </em>(täistekst <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/anthropology/documents/run-and-become---the-dissertations/pdf">siin</a>)<em><br /></em></p>&#13;
